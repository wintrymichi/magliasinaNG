"""Bridges of the road and path network (v2.0): decks over the gaps, reviewed one by one.

The DTM is the ground without bridges, so a road that follows it drops into every valley it
crosses. Every swissTLM3D line marked as a bridge (network.BRIDGE) outside the Strada Cantonale
corridor (which keeps its v1.1 surface) gets:
- a deck: the stations of the line at the heights of network_surface.py (no DTM data on a bridge:
  the smooth curve between the two approaches), flat across, as wide as the carriageway;
- a slab SLAB m thick under it, parapets on both sides (road bridges PARAPET m, footbridges RAIL
  m), piers down to the ground every PIER m where the deck is more than PIER_H m above it;
- where the deck is less than LOW m above the ground along the whole span (a culvert, a small
  stream under a road) the sides reach down to the ground instead.
The ground under a bridge is not filled: only where it rises above the underside of the slab is it
lowered to it.
v3.0: two road bridges side by side (the two carriageways of a road, a slip road beside the main one: swissTLM3D draws
a line each) with less than TWIN_GAP m between their decks are one bridge, as they are built: the gap between them is
closed by a deck of the same slab under a median MEDIAN_KERB m high, and no parapet stands along the side where the
other deck is. Up to the v3 test build they were two bridges with the river showing between them (the Via Cantonale
over the Magliasina at the Magliaso roundabout).
v3.1: survey decks. A deck drawn as a strip along the swissTLM3D line is only as wide as the line's carriageway: the
Via Cantonale over the Magliasina at the Magliaso roundabout is one deck about 25 m wide (the main road, the curve
from the west that joins it on the bridge, the sidewalk), and the strip left the river showing through it, parapets
in the middle of the road and the rest of the bridge at the height of the river bed. A bridge marked "deck": "survey"
in ponti.json is built on the outline of the cadastral survey's bridge polygons (SOSF ponte_passerella, drawn from
the aerial photos) that its line runs over; the lines over the same polygons are one deck. Its top is the plane of
the swissSURFACE3D surface model (the LiDAR returns of the deck) over the outline, eased at the edges where a road
joins it to the height of the ground there (swissALTI3D), with the side, the slab and the parapets along the edges
over a drop; the roads of the network and of the corridor stay out of the outline.
beamng/dati/ponti.json lists every bridge (swissTLM3D id, place, length, height above the ground,
the check flags) and holds the manual corrections, read back at every build:
  "z0" / "z1": deck height at the first / last end (m), "profile": "straight" (a straight deck
  between the ends) or "tlm" (the 3D line of swissTLM3D, met to the network at the ends: a footbridge
  over a road with its stairs), "type": "open" | "culvert", "skip": true (no deck: the road follows
  the ground), "deck": "survey" (v3.1: the deck on the survey's outline, above). bridge_report.py draws the
  profile and a view of every bridge for the review.
No pier stands on a road or path of the network (the one under the bridge).
