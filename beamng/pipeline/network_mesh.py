"""Drivable meshes of the whole road and path network (v2.0), on the heights of network_surface.py.

Drivable polygons (away from the Strada Cantonale corridor, which keeps the v1.1 meshes):
- the surveyed carriageways, sidewalks, islands (MU 'strada_sentiero', 'marciapiede',
  'spartitraffico') and the hard surfaces that touch them near the network ('altro_rivestimento_duro':
  yards, car parks, squares);
- a strip of the line's width along every swissTLM3D line outside those (forest roads, farm
  tracks, paths, mule tracks, stairs), asphalt or gravel after the line's surface;
- not the bridges: their decks are meshed by bridges.py.
Heights, per 0.5 m cell of a tile: every polygon belongs to the lines that run in it (a strip to
its own line and the lines at its ends); a cell takes the height of those lines at its projection
on them (linear between stations) and across the cross slope, blended between lines that agree
within BLEND_DZ; where they disagree (two roads at different levels, a wall between) the nearest
line wins and a step remains. v2.2: lines that meet at a node near the cell are one junction and
always blend (fading out between JUNCTION_R0 and JUNCTION_R1 m from the node), so a side road does
not end in a step against the road it joins. Cells far from any line (squares, car parks) get the
smoothed DTM corrected harmonically to meet the roads around them. v2.2: neighbouring cells of
different polygons (carriageway, sidewalk, yard) are one surface where their heights agree, and
where the height passes from one line to another, from a polygon to the next or to a filled
square, the cells within SEAM_R m of the seam are relaxed (Laplace over the linked cells), so the
passage is a ramp and not a kerb a car hits.
The cells of a tile make a surface_fit.Surface, so the meshing, the skirts and stone faces at the
steps and the terrain carve are the ones of v1.1 (road_mesh.py). Tiles of TILE m (whole 128 m
chunks) with MARGIN m of context.

#
# Up to v2.6 the terrain under every road mesh was carved 0.1 m under the lowest face within one
# terrain step (1.5 m) of each vertex (network_mesh.carve_tile): the terrain stays under the faces
# whatever the grade, but along a dirt track it leaves a trench 1.5 m wide on both sides and the
# track stands on it like a slab, its edge face showing 0.3-0.4 m above the ground (median; asphalt
# has kerbs and walls, an unpaved surface has none).
#
# Here the terrain around the unpaved meshes (osm_surface: gravel and dirt on roads, paths, yards)
# is raised to their surface instead:
# - every terrain vertex within SHOULDER m of an unpaved top face aims at the height of the nearest
#   point of the face, EPS under it; from there to BLEND m the aim fades back to the ground, only
#   where the ground is lower (an uphill bank stays as it is); no vertex goes down;
# - a vertex more than TALL m under that surface is left alone (a road on a wall or a bridge);
# - then the aims are lowered as little as needed to keep every terrain triangle under every road
#   face (unpaved by EPS, the others by EPS_PAVED), on the faces sampled SUB x SUB per terrain
#   square, for both ways the square may be split into triangles: a few passes spread each excess
#   on the corners by their weight, the last ones lower all three corners of an offending triangle
#   by the whole excess (never under the terrain as it was, which was safe). The blocks are solved
#   twice, the second time with the vertices of the neighbouring blocks as the first time left them.
# Then the outer edges of the unpaved meshes go down onto the raised terrain (EDGE_UP over it, at
# most EDGE_DROP m down), with the top of their edge faces: the edge between track and ground is
# 1-2 cm instead of 0.3 m. The edges against another surface (asphalt at a junction) and the seams
# between two tiles or two polygons stay where they are. The materials and grip, the AI roads and
# everything else are copied as they are.

# Paved roads, yards and pavements flush with the ground where nothing marks their edge (v2.8), in a built
# level.
#
# On v2.7 the outer edges of the paved surfaces (asphalt, setts, cobbles, pavements) stood over the terrain like a
# slab with a trench beside it: the build carves the terrain 0.1 m under the lowest road face within one terrain
# step (network_mesh.carve_tile), so that it stays under the road whatever the grade. The dirt and gravel tracks
# were laid flush in v2.7 (network_mesh.unpaved_step: the terrain raised to them and their edges lowered onto it); here the
# terrain is raised to the paved surfaces with network_mesh.main, and the surfaces stay as they are:
# - the terrain within 1.5 m of a paved top face raised to network_mesh.EPS m under its height (fading back to the
#   ground at 4.5 m, only where the ground is lower, and not where it lies more than 1 m under the road: an
#   embankment or a bridge stays as it is), never over a road face;
# - the faces are not lowered (EDGE_DROP 0): lowering the outer edges tilts the last strip of a road, where the
#   wheels of a car run, and drive_test.py counted 40-60 % more hard knocks on the roads (tried in the first
#   version of this patch);
# - the paved paths are left out: the drive test runs its car along them with the wheels on the ground beside
#   them, which the raised terrain would change;
# - none of it within KEEP_OUT m of a guard rail, a fence, a wall (and the backfill behind it), a building, the
#   railway or a bridge parapet: there the step is the real one (an embankment behind a guard rail, a kerb
#   against a wall, a plinth). The faces there raise no terrain, and the terrain vertices there stay as they were
#   also where a face farther off would raise them (the first version left them to the fade of the faces up to
#   4.5 m away: the ground rose against walls, fences and houses, up to 1 m).
# The terrain gets the date of the build step; everything else is copied as it is. The report measures the edges
# before and after.
#
# A finishing step of build_level.py (FINISH), on the built level; alone: python build_level.py --finish paved_edges
