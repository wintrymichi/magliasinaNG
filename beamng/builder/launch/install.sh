# It asks GitHub for the newest commit, downloads that commit's archive (about 330 MB) and unpacks it into the folder,
# then starts the app (the first start sets up its Python, 5-10 minutes). A folder that already holds switzerlandNG
# is updated instead (only the changed files, update-switzerlandng.sh). Builds and settings are never touched.
